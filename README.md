virastar comes with a list of flags to control its behavior, all flags are turned on by default but you can
turn them off by passing an options hash to the `persian_cleanup` method

    "سلام 123".persian_cleanup(:fix_english_numbers => false) # => "سلام 123"

here is the list of all flags:

* `fix_dashes`
* `fix_three_dots`
* `fix_english_quotes`
* `fix_hamzeh`
* `cleanup_zwnj`
* `fix_spacing_for_braces_and_quotes`

## Acknowledgment
Virastar is highly inspired by [Virasbaz](http://virasbaz.persianlanguage.ir).

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
